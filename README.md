## Milestone 1:

Program written in C++ that runs from the command line and prompts the user for SQL statements and then executes them one at a time, just like the mysql program.

To build the program:
$ make

To run the program:
$ ./sql5300 ~/cpsc5300/data

## Milestone 2:

The storage engine is made up of three layers: DbBlock, DbFile, and DbRelation.
Created a program for the implementations for the Heap Storage Engine's version of each: SlottedPage, HeapFile, and HeapTable.
